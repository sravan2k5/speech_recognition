Speech Recognition with Python
This project demonstrates how to build a Speech Recognition system in Python that can convert spoken language into written text using open-source tools. It supports microphone input and audio files, making it suitable for voice-based applications, transcription, and natural language processing tasks.

🚀 Features
🎤 Real-time speech-to-text via microphone

🔊 Transcription of pre-recorded audio files (WAV/FLAC)

🧠 Optional integration with Hugging Face models or Google Web Speech API

🔧 Simple, modular Python code

🖥️ Optional GUI using Streamlit

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

SpeechRecognition

pyaudio (for microphone access)

transformers (optional, for advanced models)

Streamlit (for optional web interface)

📦 Installation
bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio
# Optional:
pip install transformers streamlit
💡 Note: On some systems, installing pyaudio might require system-level dependencies.
